# Exercise 6.2 - Are you able to play with the toy?

Write a program that: Set as a constant the minimum height allowed to play with the toy. (Pay attention to the name and use the constant in the IF). Capture user
name and height. Validate if the height informed is smaller than the allowed.
If it is SMALLER, please inform politely, mentioning the user's name and
height, what is the minimum parameter to enter the toy. If it is not MINOR,
inform that the entry is released.
