# Exercise 3.7 - Calculating the sale price

Make a program that requests the name and cost price of any product. Afterwards, process a 65% increase and inform what the sale price will be.
Increasing a percentage value is obtained mathematically by adding the value of the product to the result of the calculation: product * (65/100), that is,
increase = product + product * (60/100).
