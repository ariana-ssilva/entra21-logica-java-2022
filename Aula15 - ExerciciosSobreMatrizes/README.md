1. Create a java project where main should serve as a menu for each execution of the exercises
The program only closes when choosing  EXIT or 0.
<br>

> Before ending the execution, thank the user for using the program;

> Switch cases should not be complex, should call specific methods;

Options in the menu:

> 1- Create 2-level arrays for each primitive type and display their size in console;

> 2- Create initialized 2-level arrays for each primitive type and display their size in console;

> 3- Create 1 array of 5 positions with 3 capacity items, for the user to feed these values;

> 4- Create an array with the size and capacity entered by the user and then ask the user to enter the respective values;

> 5- Create an initialized integer array, to loop through from start to finish, from end to beginning and to display the values;

> 6- Create an uninitialized integer array.Repeat indefinitely until the user answers "no" to the question 
"Would you like to initialize the value of one of the positions between 1 and SIZE?"
